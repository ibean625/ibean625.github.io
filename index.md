## About Me

I'm a master's student in Artificial Intelligence at [Tsinghua University](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/sjyxxyjy/list.htm) advised by Prof. [Houde Liu](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lhd/main.htm). Currently, I'm researching legged robots at the [THU-SHU Joint Lab of RoboArt & Embodied Intelligence](https://linqi-ye.github.io/), advised by Prof. [Linqi Ye](https://ai.shu.edu.cn/info/1074/1445.htm). I received my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen](http://smea.hitsz.edu.cn/) advised by Prof. [Wenfu Xu](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/xuwenfu). My interests include legged robots, reinforcement learning, emodied intelligence, and mechanical engineering.
